# Garbage-Detection-System
1. **Problem Statement:**
Urban areas in India often face illegal dumping of garbage in open spaces, roadsides, and vacant lands. These waste heaps remain unreported for long periods, leading to environmental pollution, health risks, and delayed municipal response. A practical and automated method is required to detect such garbage dumps and notify authorities with accurate location information.


2. **Objective:**
To develop a camera-based system that uses AI to detect roadside garbage heaps and automatically report their geo-location through a centralized monitoring dashboard for faster municipal action.


3. **Scope:**

- What the prototype WILL do

	•	Detect garbage heaps from images
	•	Capture GPS location
	•	Send data to backend server
	•	Show reports on dashboard map
	•	Allow status update (cleaned/not cleaned)

- What the prototype WILL NOT do

	•	Real CCTV integration
	•	Direct municipal system connection
	•	City-wide deployment
	•	Perfect 100% detection accuracy
